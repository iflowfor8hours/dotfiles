# Summary of release changes, see commit history for more details:
# https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commits/master/

* Release v21.1:

  - install.sh is rewritten to add support for --path and --destdir options,
  making it easier for package maintainers to install autojump specifically into
  certain locations. Thanks to jjk-jacky for his contributions.

* Release v21:

  - New mailing list for developer discussion and announcements:

  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups%5C#!forum/autojump

  - Switch to semantic versioning (http://semver.org/): major.minor.micro

  major = breaks backwards compatibility
  minor = new features with backwards compatibility
  micro = bug fixes with backwards compatibility

  - Migration code for v17 or older users has been removed.

  During testing, it was apparent that the migration code wasn't working to
  begin with. The major distros (Debian, RedHat) have already moved to v18+ for
  LTS. Rolling release distros and Homebrew / Macports are regularly kept up to
  date.

  Users upgrading from v17 or older will start with a new database.

  - Approximate matching introduced.

  Matching priority is now:
  1. exact match
  2. case insensitive match
  3. approximate match

  - The `j` function now accepts autojump arguments (e.g. --help, --stat).

  As a result, the `jumpstat` alias is now removed. The preferred method is `j
  --stat` or `j -s`. Consequently, autojump cannot jump to directories
  beginning with a hyphen '-'.

  - Always use case insensitive search with AUTOJUMP_IGNORE_CASE=1

  As mentioned earlier, normal priority is to prefer exact match and then check
  for case insensitive match. For users who prefer case insensitivity can now
  modify the program behavior.

  - Prevent database decay with AUTOJUMP_KEEP_ALL_ENTRIES=1

  The database is regularly trimmed for performance reasons. However users can
  prevent database maintenance with the above environmental variable.

  - ZSH tab completion fixed.

  ZSH behavior now matches Bash behavior. However it requires the `compinit`
  module to be loaded. Add the following line to ~/.zshrc:

  autoload -U compinit; compinit

  To use type:

  j<space><tab><tab>

  A menu showing the top database entries will be displayed. Type in any number
  followed by <tab> to complete the entry.

  - Database entry weight growth changed form linear to logarithmic scale.

  A combination of low total weight ceiling and linear growth resulted in
  a few, commonly used directories to be responsible for 50%+ of the total
  database weight. This caused unnecessary trimming of long tail entries.

  Switching to logarithmic growth combined with regular decay meant that
  commonly used directories still climbed database ranking appropriately with a
  more even weight distribution.

  - Vendorize argparse so now Python v2.6+ is supported (from v2.7).

  - Unit testing suite added.

  - Miscellaneous refactoring, bug fixes, documentation updates.

* Release v20:

  - Python versions supported is now v2.7+ and v3.2+ due to rewrite using
  argparse.

  - Man page and --help has been overhauled to provide better documentation and
  usage scenarios.

  - Installation scripts now act dependent on current environmental settings.

  If run as root, will do a global install. Installation script also detects
  which version to install (bash or zsh) dependent on $SHELL.  Both of these
  behaviors can be overrode using --local/--global or --bash/--zsh arguments.

  - Uninstallation script added, will remove both global and local installations
  but ignores database.

  - Allow symlink database entries with AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1

  Normally symlinks are resolved to full path to prevent duplicate database
  entries. However users who prefer symlink paths can modify behavior with the
  above environmental variable.

  - This ChangeLog added to better help package maintainers keep track of
  changes
  between releases.

  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

* Release v19:

  - prototype `cp` and `mv` directory tab completion
  - Debian post-installation instructions
  - minor Mac OS X fixes

* Release v18:

  - add automated version numbering
  - performance tweaks to reduce filesystem checks
  - add local installation option
  - unicode fixes
  - ugly fixes for Python 3
  - migrate to new database format

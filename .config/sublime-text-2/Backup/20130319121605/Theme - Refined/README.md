# Refined Theme

A Hybrid version of the Light + Dark variants from the [Aqua Theme](https://github.com/cafarm/aqua-theme).

## Installation

The best way to install Refined is through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

If you do not wish to use Package Control, clone this repository directly into the `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area (`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages` on OS X). The git clone command would be as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/danro/refined-theme.git "Theme - Refined"

### Example User Settings

    // Hybrid
    "theme": "Refined-Hybrid.sublime-theme",
    // Light
    "theme": "Refined-Light.sublime-theme",
    // Dark
    "theme": "Refined-Dark.sublime-theme",

You will have to restart Sublime for the theme to take full effect.

### Fold [...] Image

Interested in an improved fold [...] image? In the current version of Sublime this image is hard-coded to the `Theme - Default` folder. Once you've installed Soda Refined, overwrite `Packages/Theme - Default/fold.png` with `Packages/Theme - Refined/Refined-Light/fold.png`.

## Legals

This theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).

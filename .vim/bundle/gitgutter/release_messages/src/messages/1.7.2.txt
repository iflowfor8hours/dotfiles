  N O T E

    1) Diff Algrorithm

    All people who modified the "patience" setting may need to update their user settings.

    The "patience" setting is replaced by "diff_algorithm" to allow to set any of the known
    diff algorithms ("default", "minimal", "patience", "histogram") to be used by git.

    The default value remains "patience".

    2) Diff Popup

    Please note that mdpopups 2.0.0 was released which requires at least Sublime Text 3124.
    Therefore diff popup will no longer work on earlier builts if 2.0.0+ is detected.


  Fix:
   - Diff popup cuts off start of text (Issue #419)
   - Diff popup is not displayed if view is scrolled horizontal.
   - Copy text from diff popup fails
   - Limit mdpopups usage required for 2.0.0+

  Enhancement:
   - Call popup creation synchrounous to reduce delay and help avoid fighting with others
   - Scroll to beginning of reverted hunk if not in visible region.
   - Add support for git diff --histogram algorithm (Issue #422)

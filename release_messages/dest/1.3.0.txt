* Diff Popup
  - You can now get a popup to see what the code was before it was changed
  - You can do so via a command pallete, keyboard shortcut, and after
    Sublime Text 3116 is released it will auto show when hovering the gutter.
    (you can turn that off.) See the READ ME for more info.

* Protected Regions
  - Better support for protected regions and auto set bookmarks as protected.

* Bugfix
  - Fix a bug that was incorrectly warning ST2 users that it could not find git

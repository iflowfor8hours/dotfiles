The interesting plugin are

vim-fugitive - This allows you to git from inside vim. I mostly use it for doing Ggrep, then going through the quickfix windows and finding the thing I'm looking for in the code. 

vim-rsi - The normal command line bindings, in vim. Definitely makes me less crazy switching between them, and I didn't realize how often I use them (like ctrl-a for beginning of line, etc)

vim-surround - takes some getting used to and some learning but will definitely help your vim fu. 

vim-unimpaired - makes vim more aware of brackets and different types of opening and closing tags. 

The boring stuff: 

python-mode - really heavyweight, but really convenient. It's like intellij for python inside vim. Really really powerful. Also errors when you make pep-8 style errors, I dig that.

My whole .vimrc is on github, https://github.com/iflowfor8hours/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc but it's really long. Most of it is well commented. The operational settings section is safe to copy paste, there is nothing too crazy in there. 

I'll just put some of the really interesting and useful stuff here: 

set incsearch                 " incremental search
set ignorecase                " search ignoring case
set smartcase                 " Ignore case when searching lowercase
set hlsearch                  " highlight the search
set showmatch                 " show matching bracket
set diffopt=filler,iwhite     " ignore all whitespace and sync

map <F2> :set invnumber<CR> " this toggles line numbers!

" spelling checker, toggle with ,ss or F6
if v:version >= 700

      setlocal spell spelllang=en
      nmap <LocalLeader>ss :set spell!<CR>
      nmap <F6> :set spell!<CR>

endif
" default to no spelling
set nospell

"Spelling related Shortcuts using <LocalLeader>
map <LocalLeader>sn ]s
map <LocalLeader>sp [s
map <LocalLeader>sa zg
map <LocalLeader>s? z=
" When I'm pretty sure that the first suggestion is correct
map <LocalLeader>s! 1z=

" q: sucks
nmap q: :q
" If I forgot to sudo vim a file, do that with :w!!
cmap w!! w !sudo tee %
" Fix the # at the start of the line
inoremap # X<BS>#
" When I forget I'm in Insert mode, how often do you type 'jj' anyway?:
imap jj <Esc>

" Map space to / (search) and c-space to ? (backgwards search)
map <space> /
map <c-space> ?
map <LocalLeader><cr> :noh<cr>

" Smart way to move btw. windows
map <C-j> <C-W>j

map <C-h> <C-W>h
map <C-l> <C-W>l
noremap <C-n> :tabnext<CR>                                            
noremap <C-p> :tabprev<CR>
set guicursor=a:block-blinkoff1

" Use the arrows to something useful
map <right> :bnext!<cr>
map <left> :bprevious!<cr>
map <C-D> :bd<cr>

That last one about using the arrows disables them, so if you're pairing you have to turn them back on if the other person doesn't use the vim keys for movement.

The following one is life changing.
" If I forgot to sudo vim a file, do that with :w!!
